# Numeric Simulation Laboratory - Davide Nicoli
My solutions to the assignments given in the 2021/2022 edition of the laboratory.

## Code structure
The root directory of the project is organized in 5 directories plus some support files:

- `data/`: where configuration files are stored, for example the prime numbers lists or the molecular dynamics settings;
- `results/`: where results from simulations and samplings are stored. Each exercise has its own subdirectory;
- `solutions/`: it contains jupyter notebooks presenting the exercises' solutions;
- `src/`: it contains the C++ code

    "In quantum physics a **wave function**, $\\Psi$, is a mathematical description of the state of a quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued probability amplitude, and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it.\n",

    "For now on, let's consider the simple case of a non-relativistic single particle, without spin, in three spatial dimensions. The state of such a particle is completely described by its wave function, $\\Psi(\\vec{r},t)$, where $\\vec{r}$ is position and $t$ is time.\n",

    "For one spinless particle, if the wave function is interpreted as a probability amplitude, the square modulus of the wave function, $|\\Psi(\\vec{r},t)|^2$, is interpreted as the probability density that the particle is at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. Once we have a probability density, we can use Monte Carlo ...\n",
